# Deploying Your Site with Netlify

Netlify makes deploying your web projects straightforward and efficient, whether you're working with a simple static site or a complex single-page application (SPA). This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy your site on Netlify, from connecting your repository to configuring build settings and understanding the deployment process.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
- A Netlify account (you can sign up at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)).
- A Git repository (on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) containing your web project. This can be a static site, an SPA, or a site generated by a static site generator like Jekyll, Hugo, or Gatsby.
- A basic understanding of the structure of your project, including the build commands and output directory.

## 2. Connecting Your Git Repository

Netlify integrates seamlessly with Git platforms, enabling continuous deployment. Follow these steps to connect your repository:

1. **Log in to Netlify**: Sign in to your Netlify account and navigate to the dashboard.
   
2. **Create a New Site**:
   - Click on the **"New site from Git"** button.
   - Choose your Git provider (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket) and authenticate if necessary.

3. **Select Your Repository**:
   - After authentication, you’ll see a list of repositories. Select the repository that contains your web project.
   - Choose the branch you want to deploy. Typically, this is the `main` or `master` branch.

## 3. Configuring Build Settings

Netlify requires specific information to build and deploy your site. You need to provide the build command and the directory where the built files are located.

1. **Specify the Build Command**:
   - Depending on your project, this command might vary:
     - For a React app: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
     - For a Gatsby site: `gatsby build`
     - For a Hugo site: `hugo`
     - For Jekyll: `jekyll build`

   Ensure that the build command you specify is correct for your project's setup.

2. **Set the Publish Directory**:
   - The publish directory is where the output files are located after the build process.
   - Common directories:
     - For React, Vue, or Angular: `build` or `dist`
     - For Gatsby: `public`
     - For Hugo: `public`
     - For Jekyll: `_site`

   Make sure the directory name matches the output location of your build process.

3. **Environment Variables** (Optional):
   - If your project requires environment variables (e.g., API keys, environment settings), you can set them up under the **"Advanced build settings"** section. 
   - Click on **"Edit variables"** to add any necessary environment variables.

4. **Deploy Settings**:
   - Netlify allows you to configure additional deploy settings such as branch deploys, deploy previews, and more. These can be set according to your project needs.

## 4. Deploying Your Site

Once your settings are configured, you're ready to deploy your site.

1. **Click "Deploy Site"**:
   - Netlify will start building and deploying your site using the settings you provided.
   - You can view the build log in real-time to monitor the progress. If any errors occur, they will be displayed in the log, allowing you to troubleshoot.

2. **First Deployment**:
   - After the build completes successfully, your site will be deployed and available at a temporary Netlify subdomain (e.g., `your-site-name.netlify.app`).
   - You can visit this URL to see your live site.

## 5. Continuous Deployment

One of Netlify’s powerful features is continuous deployment. Every time you push changes to your connected Git repository, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy your site.

1. **Workflow**:
   - **Push changes**: Make changes to your project locally and push them to your Git repository.
   - **Automatic build and deploy**: Netlify detects the new commit, triggers a new build, and deploys the updated site.
   - **Instant updates**: The changes go live immediately after a successful build.

2. **Deploy Previews**:
   - For pull requests and branches, Netlify provides deploy previews. These are isolated builds that allow you to test changes before merging them into the main branch.
   - Each deploy preview gets its own unique URL, making it easy to share and review.

## 6. Customizing Your Deployment

Netlify offers several advanced features that allow you to customize your deployment process:

1. **Custom Domains**:
   - You can assign a custom domain to your site. From the site dashboard, navigate to **Domain settings** and add your custom domain.
   - Netlify automatically configures DNS settings and provides an SSL certificate via Let’s Encrypt, securing your site with HTTPS.

2. **Branch Deploys**:
   - Netlify allows you to deploy different branches of your repository. For example, you might deploy a `staging` branch separately from the main production branch.
   - Branch deploys are useful for testing features or working in different environments.

3. **Post-processing**:
   - Netlify offers post-processing options such as HTML minification, asset optimization, and prerendering to improve your site's performance.
   - These settings can be configured in the **Build & deploy** settings of your site.

4. **Redirects and Rewrites**:
   - You can configure redirects and URL rewrites by adding a `_redirects` file to your project. This is useful for managing routes in SPAs or handling legacy URLs.

## 7. Monitoring and Managing Deployments

Netlify provides tools to monitor and manage your deployments directly from the dashboard:

1. **Deploy Log**:
   - View detailed logs of each deploy, including build steps, errors, and warnings.
   - Use this log to troubleshoot any issues during the build process.

2. **Rollback to Previous Deploys**:
   - Netlify keeps a history of your deployments. If something goes wrong with a new deploy, you can easily roll back to a previous version of your site.

3. **Analytics**:
   - Netlify offers built-in analytics to monitor your site's performance, including page views, unique visitors, and bandwidth usage.
   - This data helps you understand how your site is performing and where improvements can be made.

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Deployment Issues

Here are some common issues you might encounter during deployment and how to resolve them:

1. **Build Failures**:
   - Ensure that the correct build command is specified and that all dependencies are installed.
   - Check the build logs for any error messages and fix issues locally before pushing changes.

2. **Incorrect Publish Directory**:
   - Double-check that the publish directory matches the output directory of your build process. If the directory is incorrect, Netlify won't be able to find your site's files to deploy.

3. **Environment Variable Issues**:
   - If your site relies on environment variables, ensure they are correctly set in Netlify’s build settings.
   - Sensitive data should never be hardcoded in your project files; always use environment variables.

4. **Custom Domain Not Working**:
   - Make sure your domain’s DNS settings are correctly configured. Netlify’s documentation provides detailed instructions on setting up DNS records for custom domains.

5. **SSL Certificate Errors**:
   - If your SSL certificate isn’t working, check that your custom domain is correctly configured and that DNS settings have propagated.

## Conclusion

Deploying your site with Netlify is a smooth process that integrates seamlessly with your development workflow. By following this guide, you can set up continuous deployment, manage custom domains, and troubleshoot any issues that arise. Netlify’s powerful features make it an excellent choice for developers looking to deploy modern web applications efficiently and securely.
