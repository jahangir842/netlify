# Managing Forms and Submissions with Netlify

Netlify makes it incredibly easy to handle form submissions without the need for additional backend infrastructure. This guide will cover how to create forms, manage submissions, and take advantage of Netlify's powerful form handling features.

## 1. Introduction to Netlify Forms

Netlify Forms allows you to add forms to your static site and have them handled by Netlify's serverless backend. With minimal setup, you can capture form submissions and view them in the Netlify dashboard or set up notifications and integrations.

### Key Features of Netlify Forms
- **No Backend Required**: Handle form submissions without setting up a server.
- **Spam Protection**: Netlify provides built-in spam protection.
- **Notification and Integration**: Get notified of new submissions and integrate with third-party services like Zapier, Slack, or email.
- **Custom Validation**: You can add custom validation to your forms using HTML5 attributes or JavaScript.

## 2. Creating a Basic Form

### Step 1: Adding a Form to Your Site

To create a form in Netlify, simply add an HTML form element with a `netlify` attribute. Here’s a basic example:

```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Your Name" required />
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your Email" required />
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your Message" required></textarea>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

### Step 2: Enabling Netlify Form Handling

The `data-netlify="true"` attribute tells Netlify to process the form submissions. When the form is submitted, Netlify captures the data and stores it in the dashboard under **Forms**.

### Hidden Form Field for SPAM Prevention

To prevent spam submissions, you can add a hidden field that only bots would fill out. If this field is filled, the submission will be marked as spam.

```html
<input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="contact" />
<div hidden>
  <input type="text" name="bot-field" />
</div>
```

### Step 3: Deploying Your Site

Deploy your site as usual, and Netlify will automatically detect the forms. Once deployed, you can test the form by submitting it and checking the Netlify dashboard for the submission.

## 3. Handling Form Submissions

### Viewing Submissions in the Dashboard

All submissions are available in the Netlify dashboard under the **Forms** tab. Here, you can view, search, and manage submissions.

### Email Notifications

You can configure Netlify to send email notifications for new submissions:

1. Go to the **Forms** section in your site’s dashboard.
2. Select the form you want to manage.
3. Click **Notifications** and add an email address where you want to receive notifications.

### Exporting Submissions

Netlify allows you to export form submissions as CSV files:

1. Navigate to the **Forms** section of your dashboard.
2. Select the form you want to export submissions from.
3. Click the **Download as CSV** button.

This is useful for backing up submissions or analyzing data.

### Setting Up ReCAPTCHA

Netlify supports Google reCAPTCHA for additional spam protection. To enable reCAPTCHA:

1. Sign up for reCAPTCHA on the [Google reCAPTCHA site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/).
2. Obtain your site key and secret key.
3. Add the following to your form:

```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" data-netlify="true" data-netlify-recaptcha="true">
  <!-- form fields -->
  <div data-netlify-recaptcha="true"></div>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
```

4. Add your secret key to your Netlify environment variables in the **Site settings** > **Build & deploy** > **Environment**.

## 4. Customizing Form Behavior

### Handling Successful Submissions

You can control what happens after a form is successfully submitted using the `action` attribute in your form. For example, redirect to a thank-you page:

```html
<form name="contact" method="POST" action="/thank-you" data-netlify="true">
  <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

### JavaScript Form Handling

If you need to handle the form submission with JavaScript, for example, to show a success message without a page reload, you can prevent the default form behavior:

```javascript
const form = document.querySelector("form");
form.addEventListener("submit", async function (e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  
  const formData = new FormData(form);
  
  const response = await fetch("/", {
    method: "POST",
    body: formData,
  });
  
  if (response.ok) {
    alert("Form submitted successfully!");
  } else {
    alert("There was a problem submitting the form.");
  }
});
```

### Using Hidden Fields

Hidden fields are useful for passing additional data along with the form submission, such as tracking information or user session data.

```html
<input type="hidden" name="user-id" value="12345" />
```

## 5. Integrating Forms with Third-Party Services

Netlify allows you to integrate form submissions with third-party services like Slack, Zapier, or custom webhooks.

### Slack Integration

To send form submissions to Slack:

1. In the **Forms** section, select your form.
2. Click **Add Notification** and choose **Slack**.
3. Configure the Slack webhook URL and select the channel where you want to receive the notifications.

### Zapier Integration

To automate workflows with Zapier:

1. Create a new Zap on [Zapier](https://zapier.com/).
2. Choose **Netlify** as the trigger app.
3. Configure the trigger to listen for new form submissions.
4. Set up the action in Zapier to perform any subsequent task, like adding the submission to a Google Sheet.

### Custom Webhooks

To send form submissions to a custom webhook:

1. Go to the **Forms** section and select your form.
2. Click **Add Notification** and choose **Webhook**.
3. Enter the URL of your webhook endpoint.

This is useful for integrating with custom APIs or services.

## 6. Advanced Form Features

### File Uploads

Netlify supports file uploads in forms. Uploaded files are stored in Netlify's media storage and can be accessed from the **Forms** section in the dashboard.

```html
<form name="upload" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
  <input type="file" name="myfile" />
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

### Conditional Logic

While Netlify doesn't natively support conditional logic in forms, you can use JavaScript to show or hide fields based on user input.

```javascript
document.querySelector("#dropdown").addEventListener("change", function () {
  const value = this.value;
  const hiddenField = document.querySelector("#hiddenField");

  if (value === "show") {
    hiddenField.style.display = "block";
  } else {
    hiddenField.style.display = "none";
  }
});
```

### Custom Validation

You can add custom validation to your forms using HTML5 attributes or JavaScript. For example, to require that a phone number is 10 digits:

```html
<input type="text" name="phone" pattern="\d{10}" title="Please enter a 10-digit phone number" required />
```

For more complex validation, you can use JavaScript:

```javascript
form.addEventListener("submit", function (e) {
  const phoneInput = form.querySelector("[name='phone']");
  
  if (!/^\d{10}$/.test(phoneInput.value)) {
    e.preventDefault();
    alert("Please enter a valid 10-digit phone number.");
  }
});
```

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Form Issues

### Form Not Appearing in Dashboard

- Ensure that the form has the `data-netlify="true"` attribute.
- Check that the form name is unique and not shared with another form.
- Make sure the form is on a page that was deployed. If you’re using a static site generator, ensure that the page containing the form was generated and deployed.

### Submissions Marked as Spam

- If legitimate submissions are marked as spam, consider adjusting your form's fields or adding reCAPTCHA.
- Check the submission logs in the Netlify dashboard for more details on why submissions are flagged.

### No Email Notifications

- Verify that the notification settings are correctly configured in the dashboard.
- Check the spam or junk folder in your email.
- Ensure that your email provider isn’t blocking Netlify's notification emails.
