# Custom Domains with Netlify

Netlify makes it easy to connect your site to a custom domain, allowing you to use your own branded URL. This guide will cover the process of adding a custom domain to your Netlify site, configuring DNS settings, and managing domain settings.

## 1. Introduction to Custom Domains

Custom domains enhance your brand's presence online and make your site more professional. Netlify allows you to use your own domain name with their hosting service. This involves configuring DNS settings and ensuring proper SSL/TLS certification.

### Benefits of Using a Custom Domain
- **Branding**: Improve brand recognition and trust with a custom domain.
- **SEO**: Boost search engine optimization by using a domain that matches your business or content.
- **Professionalism**: Provide a more polished and credible appearance for your site.

## 2. Adding a Custom Domain to Your Netlify Site

### Step 1: Register a Domain

If you haven’t already, you’ll need to register a domain with a domain registrar such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains. Make sure you have access to your domain registrar’s DNS settings.

### Step 2: Access Domain Settings in Netlify

1. Log in to your Netlify account.
2. Go to your site’s **Site settings**.
3. Click on **Domain management** in the sidebar.
4. Click the **Add custom domain** button.

### Step 3: Add Your Custom Domain

1. Enter your custom domain name (e.g., `www.example.com`) in the provided field.
2. Click **Verify** to check if the domain is correctly registered and accessible.
3. Click **Add domain** to complete the process.

## 3. Configuring DNS Settings

### Step 1: Update DNS Records

To point your domain to Netlify, you need to update the DNS records at your domain registrar. This typically involves setting up `A` records or `CNAME` records.

#### For Apex Domains (e.g., `example.com`):

- **A Records**: Point your apex domain to Netlify’s IP addresses.
  - `104.198.14.52`
  - `34.102.136.180`

#### For Subdomains (e.g., `www.example.com`):

- **CNAME Record**: Point your subdomain to Netlify’s domain.
  - Host: `www`
  - Value: `your-site-name.netlify.app`

### Step 2: Verify DNS Settings

1. After updating your DNS settings, go back to your Netlify site’s **Domain management** page.
2. Click **Check DNS configuration** to verify that Netlify can detect the correct settings.
3. DNS changes can take some time to propagate, so it might take a few hours to see the changes.

## 4. Enabling HTTPS with SSL/TLS

Netlify automatically provides SSL/TLS certificates for custom domains using Let’s Encrypt, ensuring secure connections to your site.

### Step 1: Automatic SSL/TLS Setup

1. Once your domain is correctly pointed to Netlify and DNS changes are propagated, Netlify will automatically issue and configure an SSL/TLS certificate for your domain.
2. You can check the status of your certificate in the **Domain management** section under **HTTPS**.

### Step 2: Custom SSL/TLS Certificates

If you have a custom SSL/TLS certificate that you want to use, you can upload it to Netlify:

1. Go to the **Domain management** page in your Netlify dashboard.
2. Click **Manage SSL/TLS certificates**.
3. Click **Upload a certificate** and follow the prompts to upload your certificate files.

### Step 3: Enforce HTTPS

To ensure all traffic uses HTTPS:

1. Go to the **Domain management** page.
2. Under the **HTTPS** section, enable **Force HTTPS**.
3. This setting will redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS.

## 5. Managing Multiple Domains

### Adding Multiple Domains

You can add multiple domains to a single Netlify site:

1. Go to **Domain management** in your Netlify site’s settings.
2. Click **Add custom domain** to add additional domains.
3. Configure DNS settings for each domain as needed.

### Setting a Primary Domain

If you have multiple domains, you can set one as the primary domain:

1. In the **Domain management** section, select the domain you want to set as primary.
2. Click **Set as primary**. This domain will be the default for your site.

### Redirecting Domains

You can set up domain redirects if you want to forward one domain to another:

1. Go to **Domain management**.
2. Click **Add domain alias**.
3. Enter the domain you want to redirect and specify the primary domain.

## 6. Troubleshooting Domain Issues

### Domain Not Resolving

- **Check DNS Settings**: Ensure that your DNS settings are correctly configured and propagated.
- **Verify Domain Registration**: Ensure that your domain is correctly registered and not expired.
- **Check Netlify Status**: Verify that there are no ongoing issues with Netlify’s services.

### SSL/TLS Certificate Errors

- **Check DNS Configuration**: Ensure that DNS records are correctly set up and propagated.
- **Force HTTPS**: Make sure HTTPS is enforced in your Netlify settings.
- **Certificate Expiration**: Check if your SSL/TLS certificate has expired and needs renewal.

### DNS Propagation Delays

DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to fully propagate. Use tools like [DNS Checker](https://www.dnschecker.org/) to monitor propagation status.
