# Identity and Authentication with Netlify

Netlify Identity is a powerful feature that allows you to manage users and authentication in your static site. This guide will cover setting up Netlify Identity, managing users, and integrating third-party authentication providers.

## 1. Introduction to Netlify Identity

Netlify Identity provides a complete, serverless authentication solution built directly into your Netlify site. With Netlify Identity, you can:

- **Manage User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and log out users.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to specific pages or content based on user roles.
- **Integrate with OAuth Providers**: Allow users to log in with third-party services like Google, GitHub, and others.
- **User Management**: Manage user profiles, roles, and data.

Netlify Identity uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for secure, stateless authentication.

## 2. Setting Up Netlify Identity

### Step 1: Enable Netlify Identity

1. Go to your site’s **Site settings** in the Netlify dashboard.
2. Click on **Identity** in the sidebar.
3. Click the **Enable Identity** button to activate Netlify Identity.

### Step 2: Configure Registration and Login Settings

Once Identity is enabled, you can configure the following:

- **Registration Preferences**: Choose whether anyone can sign up or if registration is invite-only.
- **Email Templates**: Customize the email templates for sign-up confirmation, password recovery, etc.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Assign roles to users and restrict access to certain areas of your site based on these roles.

### Step 3: Add the Netlify Identity Widget

Netlify provides a handy widget that allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles directly from your site.

To add the widget:

1. Include the following script tag in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"></script>
```

2. Add a button to trigger the widget:

```html
<button onclick="netlifyIdentity.open()">Login</button>
```

3. Initialize the widget in your JavaScript:

```javascript
if (window.netlifyIdentity) {
  window.netlifyIdentity.on("init", user => {
    if (!user) {
      window.netlifyIdentity.on("login", () => {
        document.location.href = "/dashboard/";
      });
    }
  });
}
```

### Step 4: Deploy Your Site

After setting up Netlify Identity, deploy your site. Once deployed, users will be able to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts directly from your site.

## 3. Managing Users and Roles

### Viewing Users in the Dashboard

Netlify Identity users can be managed from the **Identity** tab in the Netlify dashboard. Here, you can:

- **View User Profiles**: See user details such as email, role, and sign-up date.
- **Manage Roles**: Assign or change user roles.
- **Invite Users**: Send email invitations to new users.

### Role-Based Access Control

Roles allow you to control access to different parts of your site. For example, you can create a role called `admin` and restrict access to admin-only pages.

To restrict access to a page:

1. Add a `_redirects` file in your site's root directory.
2. Include the following rule:

```
/admin/*    200!  Role=admin
```

This rule restricts access to any page under the `/admin/` path to users with the `admin` role.

### Customizing User Experience

You can customize the user experience by listening to Netlify Identity events and updating your site accordingly. For example, you can show or hide elements based on whether a user is logged in:

```javascript
netlifyIdentity.on("login", user => {
  document.getElementById("login-btn").style.display = "none";
  document.getElementById("logout-btn").style.display = "block";
});

netlifyIdentity.on("logout", () => {
  document.getElementById("login-btn").style.display = "block";
  document.getElementById("logout-btn").style.display = "none";
});
```

## 4. Integrating Third-Party OAuth Providers

Netlify Identity supports OAuth 2.0, allowing users to sign in with external providers like Google, GitHub, and others.

### Step 1: Enable OAuth Providers

1. In the Netlify dashboard, navigate to the **Identity** tab.
2. Scroll down to the **External Providers** section.
3. Enable the providers you want to support, such as Google, GitHub, or GitLab.

### Step 2: Customize the Login Button

To allow users to log in with a third-party provider, add a button to your site:

```html
<button onclick="netlifyIdentity.open('login')">Log in with Google</button>
```

Users can now sign in using their credentials from the selected provider.

### Step 3: Handle OAuth Logins

Netlify Identity handles the OAuth flow, but you can add custom logic if needed. For example, redirect users to a specific page after logging in with Google:

```javascript
netlifyIdentity.on("login", user => {
  if (user.app_metadata.provider === "google") {
    document.location.href = "/dashboard/";
  }
});
```

## 5. Advanced Identity Customization

### Custom JWT Claims

You can customize the JWT token issued by Netlify Identity to include additional claims or data. This is useful for passing user-specific information to your application.

To add custom claims:

1. In the **Identity** settings, go to the **Advanced** section.
2. Add custom claims using the Netlify Functions.

Here’s an example of how to add a custom claim using a Netlify Function:

```javascript
exports.handler = async function(event, context) {
  const claims = context.clientContext && context.clientContext.user;
  
  if (claims) {
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: "Hello, " + claims.email
      })
    };
  }
  
  return {
    statusCode: 401,
    body: JSON.stringify({
      message: "Unauthorized"
    })
  };
};
```

### Custom Redirects After Login

You can control the redirect behavior after login by using the `data-redirect` attribute in your login form or button:

```html
<button onclick="netlifyIdentity.open('login')" data-redirect="/dashboard/">Login</button>
```

This ensures that after logging in, users are redirected to the specified page.

### Managing User Metadata

Netlify Identity allows you to store custom metadata for each user. You can access and update this metadata through the API:

```javascript
const user = netlifyIdentity.currentUser();
user.update({
  data: { 
    preferences: {
      theme: "dark"
    }
  }
}).then(() => {
  console.log("User metadata updated");
});
```

### Handling Email Confirmations

If you require email confirmation for new users, you can manage this through the Netlify Identity settings. You can customize the confirmation email, and users will be prompted to confirm their email before accessing protected areas of your site.

## 6. Securing Your Site with Netlify Identity

### Protecting Routes

You can protect specific routes on your site using Netlify Identity and JWT-based access control. For example, you can protect all `/admin` routes by checking the user's role before serving the content.

### Securing API Calls

When making API calls from your frontend to your backend or serverless functions, include the user's JWT token to secure the request:

```javascript
const token = user.token.access_token;

fetch("/.netlify/functions/secure-function", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`
  }
}).then(response => {
  return response.json();
}).then(data => {
  console.log(data);
});
```

This ensures that only authenticated users with valid JWT tokens can access your API.

## 7. Troubleshooting Common Identity Issues

### Users Not Receiving Emails

- **Check Spam/Junk Folders**: Ask users to check their spam or junk email folders.
- **Verify DNS Settings**: Ensure your DNS settings are correctly configured for sending emails. This may include adding SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records.
- **Resend Confirmation**: You can manually resend a confirmation email from the Netlify Identity dashboard.

### Problems with OAuth Logins

- **Verify OAuth Configuration**: Make sure that the OAuth providers are correctly configured in the Netlify dashboard.
- **Check Redirect URIs**: Ensure that the redirect URIs match between your Netlify settings and the OAuth provider's settings.

### Handling Unauthorized Access

If users are gaining access to protected areas without proper authentication, ensure that:

- **JWT Tokens**: Check that JWT tokens are being correctly issued and validated.
- **Role-Based Access**: Confirm that roles are correctly assigned and that your `_redirects` file is properly configured.
